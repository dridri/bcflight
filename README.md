Open-source Linux-based Raspberry drone and ground controller.

## Features
 * Supports Raspberry Pi 1/2/3/4/zero boards
 * Low CPU (<10% on Raspberry Pi 4) and RAM (~100MB) usage
 * Sensors and stabilizer loop-time up to 8kHz (on rPi4)
 * Up to 8 motors with customizable configuration matrix
 * DShot (150 & 300), OneShot125 and standard PWM motor protocols
 * Supports SPI and I²C [sensors](#supported-sensors)
 * LUA-based configuration, with fully configurable event-handling and user code execution
 * Homemade communication protocol over Wifi & FSK/LoRa radio, also supports S-BUS with limited functionnality
 * <4ms controls latency
 * <=50ms video latency (over composite output to 5GHz VTX module)
 * Live camera view over HDMI / Composite output with On-Screen Display (showing telemetry, battery status, fly speed, acceleration...)
 * Multiple camera recording in MKV file format
 * Supports [Gyroflow](https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow) GCSV output
