## Radio
- Make LoRa work eventually


## Camera
- Build a tilt camera system, using AHRS pitch to keep horizontal (or use a dynamic parameter?)
   - the HUD horizon must include the tilt value if !=0


## Sensors
- Fine-tune horizon stabilization
- Finish altitude measuring


## Config
- finish switching from `flight_register` to LUA parser
- Allow execution of user-written Lua functions, with a decent API allowing access to almost everything
